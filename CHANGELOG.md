# Changelog

## 1.9.0 — 2026-07-19

### One living engineering memory for the whole team

Hunch can now connect a codebase to a dedicated private Git repository that holds the team's
decisions, corrections, constraints, policies, and proofs. Commit the generated
`.hunch/team.json` pointer once; a fresh clone running `hunch init` validates and connects its own
ignored local memory clone, and connected MCP sessions refresh at tool-request boundaries.

Shared captures commit and synchronize automatically by default. Concurrent structured records
merge deterministically, public-only checks exclude the shared graph, and strict checks refuse to
pass on a stale or unverified team route. Corrections can be upgraded into proof-backed proposals,
but those correction proposals remain mechanically non-activatable until source-currentness safety
lands. Other policy types still gain no authority unless a human explicitly accepts them.

To move an existing code repository's public Hunch records into the shared store, use
`hunch shared --repo <separate-private-memory-repo> --migrate`. Omit `--migrate` for a new setup.
Upgrade with `npm i -g @davesheffer/hunch@1.9.0`; the documented rollback keeps the memory
repository intact while disabling enforcement and automatic publication before pinning a previous
package version.

The complete release history remains available on the
[Hunch changelog](https://hunch-pi.vercel.app/changelog).
